I was asked by some friends at the International Zen Dojo to take over as webmaster for their website. Prior to this they had their site pre-built and hosted on a server, but wanting to take control of the look and function of it, they asked me to develop the pages for them. Having just started experiencing web development with a new job at UH and a few ICS courses, I was ready with fresh, innovative ideas to contribute.

## Understanding the Client's Requests

The biggest change that the client wanted was in the layout of the pages. Previously the pages were spread out individually and the user had to figure out where to go to find the next page in the sequence. The client wanted to change this into a slideshow-type layout where the user would only have to click, and the next slide would be shown. This would drastically reduce the number of individual pages needed, making it easier to navigate. Also, considering that the demographics of the users are mostly adults that are not necessarily comfortable with technology, we wanted to make it as easy as possible to use.

## Finding the Right Tool

So my search began to find the best tool for the job to make the slideshow part of the pages. There are a lot of tools out there, and even ways to create slideshows with just HTML and CSS, but most of them were for embedding slideshows of images within a paragraph of text (or something of that sort). The client wanted the slideshow to take up the whole screen, *and* be able to include images and text, just as a typical slideshow presentation would. In the beginning, I wanted to code it by hand, because there is a level of pride and satisfaction that comes with being able to come up with a solution all by yourself. But as the implementation became tougher I ran into more problems, and for a novice (at the time) web developer like me, the rate of success just wasn't worth it. Eventually I landed upon [lightSlider](http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightslider/), and it works quite nicely. Tools like this are out there and they were created for a reason-- to be used. If it works how you need it to, then there really is no reason not to use it.

## REALLY Understanding the Client's Requests

Coming straight out of a class that I took where we learned and implemented a lot of front-end development "best practices", I was eager to use all of those things in this website as well. Attributes such as web responsiveness-- where content and design scale automatically to different screen sizes, font/color scheme readability, grabbing the reader, etc. were qualities that I wanted to have in the website. I quickly got to work implementing all of these practices-- using fonts that were lightweight and readible, making sure that the pages were responsive to all screen sizes, and so on... only to come back to an email from the client asking to change the fonts back to Times New Roman, and to just focus on desktop-sized screen layouts. So, as reluctant as I was to do it, I knew I had to comply. It was at that moment that I realized where the balance of power was. On one hand, the client can request anything they want, but if it's literally not possible, then I have to refuse it, or at least discuss it to come up with a better, feasible solution. On the other hand, no matter how much knowledge and insight I have, if it's not what the client wants, then it's not what the client gets. Unless there are security risks that *need* to be addressed, sometimes it needs to be left out. And that's okay. After all, the client isn't trying to attract new customers or advertise anything, so there's really no downside to it.

*This has been a very brief overview and reflection of my first experience building a website for a customer. The website still goes through minor and major changes periodically. To view the live site, please visit* http://chozen-ji.org/

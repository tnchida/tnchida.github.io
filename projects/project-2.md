summary: Learning how to convert hard-copy books to digital versions.
---

I was asked by some friends to help with converting a few books into digital versions that could be uploaded to Amazon's Kindle library to be purchased and read by customers. I had never done this before, but it seemed simple enough. Amazon has a few tools that make doing this pretty easy.

The first book I was asked to convert was a Children's Book. Images serve as the backgrounds of each page, and text is normally placed anywhere and everywhere, rather than nicely formatted in orderly paragraphs.

summary: Currently developing a personalized home-security system with photoelectric sensors and a Raspberry Pi 3.
---

Currently in its very beginning stages of development, I am attempting to set up a home security alert system that will notify users when a visitor has arrived. I will be using wireless photoelectric sensors to detect motion, and a Raspberry Pi 3 to send SMS messages and/or push notifications whenever path of the sensor is crossed. This project will involve the use of the Python programming language, but more importantly, A LOT of problem-solving skills. This is my first project with a Raspberry Pi, and also my first attempt at a hands-on project like this, so I will definitely be tinkering with it for a while, as well as relying on Google to connect me to the trusty community of fellow Do-It-Yourself-ers out there.
